# Python Password Generator

Welcome to the repository for my Password Generator, written in Python 3.

Passwords generated by this program will contain a mix of Letters, Numbers
and Symbols. Also, there is no limit on how big a password can be.

# Installation

You can download the Source Code from this repository and run it through the
terminal. I have also compiled an executable with PyInstaller for those that
are running Windows. You can find said executables in the <a href="https://github.com/105hua/Python-Password-Generator/releases">Releases</a> section.

# Usage

Provided you have Python 3 installed, simply open a terminal inside of the
directory which you have downloaded the Python File to and run the command
"py ./main.py". If you are using the precompiled Windows Executable, then
simply double click on the file to run the program.
